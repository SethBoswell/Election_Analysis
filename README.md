# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has tasked me with performing an election audit for a recent local congressional election and determining the following information:

1. Determine the total number of votes that were cast in the election
2. Get a complete list of all the candidates who participated in the election
3. Determine the number of votes cast for each candidate
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on which candidate won the largest number and percentage of votes

Additionally, the Challenge Assignment required to me to perform a county-level analysis to determine the following information about the election:

1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total votes cast in the election
3. The county that had the largest turnout for this election
